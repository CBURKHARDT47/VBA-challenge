Background
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called VBA-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Inside this repository are any VBA files used for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

The instructions were to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

-The ticker symbol

-Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

-Conditional formatting was used to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

-Ensured that the script acted the same on every sheet. 

-The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following images.

*Moderate solution was to : Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

**Hard solution was to : Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

NOTES:
Code Source: I referenced code on Stack Overflow Forums, GitHub Open Source Code, and Learning Assistant/ChatGBT for the code within the VBA file: Sub ThreeYearStockAnalysis.vbs. I did not garner help from any TAs, tutors, or peers on this specific challenge.
